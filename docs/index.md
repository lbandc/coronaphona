## CoronaPhona

Using [Twilio](https://twilio.com), we provide a simple, single helpline that vulnerable people in your community can call. This will seamlessly connect them to local volunteers in a round-robin manner, so they don't have to call or remember a list of telephone numbers.

### We want to support the vulnerable during this crisis 

The vulnerable in your community may not be digitally active - they may not know about Facebook groups, community volunteer groups or similar. For this reason we wanted to provide a single number that they can call to be connected to volunteers in their local area who might be able to help them in times of need.

### Get involved

We can only do this with your help! If you are interested in helping the vulnerable in your community or you already know of a community volunteer group that would benefit from this, please get in touch with us via email at [coronaphona@gmail.com](mailto:coronaphona@gmail.com).
